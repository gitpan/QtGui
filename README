Perl/Qt4
=========================

Creating this library we aimed to use the Perl functionality 
as much as possible, but to make the syntax similar to C++ Qt4.
This allows to use the original Qt4 documentation.
All the list classes (QVector,QList) are replaced by the Perl arrays.
All the associated arrays (QMap,QHash,QPair) are replaced by Perl hashes.
The classes of modules are completely coincide with the corresponding  ones of C++ Qt4.
One can use all the protected functions from the object classes (QObject children) 
except of those that use *Private classes as input parameter.

It's advisable to study the examples attached before writing programs.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL [option]
   make
   make test
   make install
   
Options:
   -i include directory for Qt, default /usr/include
   -qc diretory with Perl QtCore sources for copy *.core files, 
        default ../QtCore (need for QtGui and other top level libraries)
example:
   perl Makefile.PL -i /usr/local/include -qc ../QtCore-4.000

for QtGui:
If you do not point  -qc key, you will have to copy redef.h, all 
the files *.core and typemap to the QtGui catalogue from the QtCore catalogue. 
Then it is necessary to rename "typemap" to "typemap.core".
   

NOTES

You will work with the Qt4 classes not directly but through their children.

All the Qt4 classes in Perl are blessed hashes.
A real pointer to the class can be found in $qt_class->{_ptr} and must not be changed.

Because it is impossible to overload operator= in Perl one should use 
the constructor of copies in order to copy the classes:
   my $qstring2 = QString($qstring1);

Several functions which names coincide with Perl reserved words are shifted to capital letters.
They are TR, TRUtf8, CONNECT, METHOD, SLOT, SIGNAL.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
Perl 5.8 and Trolltech Qt4 (4.2 or later),
Perl Qt4 QtCore library (need for QtGui and other top level libraries).
